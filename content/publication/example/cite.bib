abstract = {The enormous energy use of the building sector and the requirements for indoor living quality that aim to improve occupants'productivity and health, prioritize Smart Buildings as an emerging technology. The Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning ( HVAC ) system is considered one of the most critical and essential parts in buildings since it consumes the largest amount of energy and is responsible for humans comfort. Due to the intermittent operation of HVAC systems, faults are more likely to occur, possibly increasing eventually building's energy consumption and - or downgrading indoor living quality. The complexity and large scale nature of HVAC systems complicate the diagnosis of faults in a centralized framework. This paper presents a distributed intelligent fault diagnosis algorithm for detecting and isolating multiple sensor faults in large-scale HVAC systems. Modeling the HVAC system as a network of interconnected subsystems allows the design of a set of distributed sensor fault diagnosis agents capable of isolating multiple sensor faults by applying a combinatorial decision logic and diagnostic reasoning. The performance of the proposed method is investigated with respect to robustness, fault detectability and scalability. Simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in the presence of multiple sensor faults applied to a 83-zone HVAC system and to evaluate the sensitivity of the method with respect to sensor noise variance.},

The proposed methodology is developed in a distributed framework, considering a multi-zone HVAC system as a set of interconnected, nonlinear subsystems. For each of the interconnected subsystems, we design a local virtual sensor agent that can detect and isolate faults in its monitored sensors and provide sensor fault estimations for correcting the faulty measurements. Adaptive estimation schemes are implemented in each local virtual sensor agent, using adaptive approximation models for learning the unknown fault function.

@article{Reppa2014TCST,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. This paper presents a design and analysis methodology for detecting and isolating multiple sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems. The proposed methodology is developed in a distributed framework, considering a multizone HVAC system as a set of interconnected nonlinear subsystems. A dedicated local sensor fault diagnosis (LSFD) agent is designed for each subsystem, while it may exchange information with other LSFD agents. Distributed sensor fault detection is conducted using robust analytical redundancy relations of estimation-based residuals and adaptive thresholds. The distributed sensor fault isolation procedure is carried out by combining the decisions of the LSFD agents and applying a reasoning-based decision logic. The performance of the proposed methodology is analyzed with respect to robustness, sensor fault detectability, and isolability. Simulation results are used for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology applied to an eight-zone HVAC system.},
